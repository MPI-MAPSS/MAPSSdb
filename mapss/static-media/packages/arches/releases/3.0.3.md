*June 2, 2015*

The Arches team is happy to announce a updates to the Arches and Arches-HIP applications.   It's recommended that you upgrade as soon as possible.

Steps to upgrade:

* Stop the web server hosting Arches and stop the elastic search service
* For users who pip installed Arches or Arches-HIP simply run the pip "upgrade" command from the activated virtual environment where Arches (or Arches-HIP) was installed:
* eg: pip install arches --upgrade (or pip install arches_hip --upgrade).  
* If you pulled directly from the repository, then all you have to do is pull the latest.
* Restart the web server and elastic search service
