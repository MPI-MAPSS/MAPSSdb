### Upgrading Arches
1. You must be upgraded to at least version 6.0 before proceeding.

2. Be sure to backup your database before proceeding

3. Upgrade to Arches 6.1.0

        pip install --upgrade arches

4. Within your project with your Python 3 virtual environment activated:

        python manage.py migrate

5. **Important:** If you are maintaining an Arches package, be sure to export your graphs and resource instance data before re-importing or reloading your package. 

### Upgrading an Arches project

    
1. Update your JavaScript dependencies

    Your project's package.json file looks something like this (Yours maybe different, but only `arches` and packages supporting project customizations will be listed in the dependencies):

    ```    
    {
        "name": "myproject",
        "dependencies": {
            "arches": "archesproject/arches#stable/6.1.0",
        }
    }
    ```
    Change the arches version number from to `#stable/6.2.0`\
    Then cd to your project's package.json file directory and run: `yarn install`

    **If your package.json does not have arches listed as a dependency**, follow the instructions of [step 1 here](https://github.com/archesproject/arches/blob/master/releases/5.1.0.md#upgrading-an-arches-project) to update your package.json file. Be sure to use #stable/6.1.0 as the version number for arches when you update your package.json file.
    
    Once your package.json file is updated, run:

    ```yarn install```
